The blue line is the common solution to two of these equations.\n\nLinear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis, a branch of mathematical analysis, may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to function spaces.\n\nLinear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of engineering because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For nonlinear systems, which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with first-order approximations, using the fact that the differential of a multivariate function at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.\n\nHistory[edit]\nSee also: Determinant \u00a7\u00a0History, and Gaussian elimination \u00a7\u00a0History\n\nThe procedure (using counting rods) for solving simultaneous linear equations now called Gaussian elimination appears in the ancient Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight: Rectangular Arrays of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations.[4]\n\nSystems of linear equations arose in Europe with the introduction in 1637 by Ren\u00e9 Descartes of coordinates in geometry. In fact, in this new geometry, now called Cartesian geometry, lines and planes are represented by linear equations, and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations.\n\nThe first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants and were first considered by Leibniz in 1693. In 1750, Gabriel Cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of linear systems, now called Cramer's rule. Later, Gauss further described the method of elimination, which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy.[5]\n\nIn 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his \"Theory of Extension\" which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix, which is Latin for womb.\n\nLinear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane. For instance, two numbers w and z in \n\ud835\udc36\n have a difference w \u2013 z, and the line segments wz and 0(w \u2212 z) are of the same length and direction. The segments are equipollent. The four-dimensional system \n\ud835\udc3b\n of quaternions was discovered by W.R. Hamilton in 1843.[6] The term vector was introduced as v = xi + yj + zk representing a point in space. The quaternion difference p \u2013 q also produces a segment equipollent to pq. Other hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of a linear space with a basis.\n\nArthur Cayley introduced matrix multiplication and the inverse matrix in 1856, making possible the general linear group. The mechanism of group representation became available for describing complex and hypercomplex numbers. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants and wrote \"There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants\".[5]\n\nBenjamin Peirce published his Linear Associative Algebra (1872), and his son Charles Sanders Peirce extended the work later.[7]\n\nThe telegraph required an explanatory system, and the 1873 publication by James Clerk Maxwell of A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism instituted a field theory of forces and required differential geometry for expression. Linear algebra is flat differential geometry and serves in tangent spaces to manifolds. Electromagnetic symmetries of spacetime are expressed by the Lorentz transformations, and much of the history of linear algebra is the history of Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe first modern and more precise definition of a vector space was introduced by Peano in 1888;[5] by 1900, a theory of linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces had emerged. Linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra. The development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for Gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions, and linear algebra became an essential tool for modeling and simulations.[5]\n\nVector spaces[edit]\nMain article: Vector space\n\nUntil the 19th century, linear algebra was introduced through systems of linear equations and matrices.

So far, teams have done a good job presenting the selected applications and connecting them to the core concepts we\u2019ve covered in class.\n\nFor your written reports, I\u2019d like to see a more critical perspective on the applications you analyzed. Think about questions such as:\n\nDo you agree with all the choices made by the product designers?\nDid they achieve their stated goals effectively?\nWas their chosen approach the best one?\n\nUse what you\u2019ve learned in this class to analyze and evaluate the design decisions, not just describe them. If you agree with the designers\u2019 choices, explain why and discuss possible alternatives. If you think they could have made better decisions, don\u2019t hesitate to say so.\n\nMost teams have already presented, so there\u2019s no need to revise your slides. But please incorporate this reflection into your written reports. For teams presenting on Wednesday, you\u2019re welcome to use this feedback to strengthen your oral presentations as well.\n\nThanks,\nMark\n\nShow More\nView on Piazza\nAssignment 3 Has Been Posted\n10/06/25 - 3:18 PM\n\nAssignment 3 has been posted.
